# What is this about? 

Recently, GitHub made the [Issues forms](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-06-23-issues-forms-beta-for-public-repositories/) beta available for all public repositories. It is meant to put structure in place when creating issues, but this also allows a new way of codeless collaborating. Imagine rather than forking, editing a file, create a commit, all you have to do is opening an issue. Check out the [Codeless Contributions with GitHub Issue Forms](https://stefanbuck.com/blog/codeless-contributions-with-github-issue-forms) post on my blog to learn more.

This is just an example using the [pizza order issue template](https://github.com/stefanbuck/ristorante/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/order-pizza.yml) and [github-issue-parser](https://github.com/stefanbuck/github-issue-parser) to convert issues into a unified JSON structure. 

A real-world example can be found in the [awesome-browser-extensions-for-github](https://github.com/stefanbuck/awesome-browser-extensions-for-github/issues/new?assignees=&labels=submit&template=submit-extension.yml&title=Submit+new+extension) repository, where submitting a new extension is easy as filling a new issue. A GitHub Actions runs and turns the issue into a code contribution when appliying the label `merge`.

Now give it a try, and [order some :pizza:](https://github.com/stefanbuck/ristorante/issues/new?assignees=&labels=order&template=order-pizza.yml&title=Order+Pizza)
